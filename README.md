# automating_astrophotgraphy
Since I got my amateur telescope in the 3rd grade, I've looked at the sky everytime I could. However, after some time, you get tired of tediously aiming at far away worlds. Here's where this project comes in : with a raspberry pi, a few motors and senors, a Pi Cam, + A LOT of trial and error, I'm trying to automate this hobby of mine.

UPDATE (19/08/2025) :

Since the hardware part went kaput (the motors were too weak and the time new ones would arrive, I'd be at school again), this project is not (at least currently) in development
anymore. Maybe I'll get around to finishing it when the holidays will arrive.
